# nvi_asthma
Creation of multi-domain index to map vulnerability to adverse asthma outcomes

## 1. Overview:
We developed a Neighborhood Environmental Vulnerability Index (NEVI) to measure vulnerability of each census tract in New York City to Childhood Asthma.
We made use of an R package toxpiR (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/toxpiR/index.html) to integrate data across different domain, characterize neighborhood vulnerability to childhood asthma in New York City (NYC), and determine if sources of vulnerability varied across neighborhoods.
